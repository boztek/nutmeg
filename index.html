Nutmeg is a learning tool for PHP educators (and students). It provides a
minimal wrapper around students PHP exercises in a way which handles mistakes
gracefully, helps students and teachers understand their code, and takes care of
basic things which students shouldn't have to write in a PHP class, like table
styles.

## Features

* Prepare a set of PHP exercises for Students to try out
* Web front-end for listing exercises
* Side-by-side comparison of students code and output, in the browser
* PHP syntax highlighting
* Graceful error handling for student's code
* Reskin with CSS (currently limited)
* GPL v2 licenced

## Nutmeg for educators

Nutmeg helps you help student to learn PHP, by providing a way to serve up PHP
exercises in a relatively straightforward way.

### Getting set up

Requirements:
* [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)

1. Download or checkout the latest version of Nutmeg.
2. Run `composer install` to get the dependencies and autoloaders built.
3. Visit `/exercises` to customise the exercises available to your students.
* The list of exercises is stored in `/exercises/config.yaml`
* Each exercise is a simple PHP file.

## Nutmeg for students

If you don't already know PHP, Nutmeg is not currently ready for you to start
using it without the supervision of a tutor.

## Roadmap

Nutmeg is in early Alpha. Its basic code loading and viewing features are complete,
but are not extensively tested.

Some of the features we have in mind:

* Load sample code into exercise view
* Better syntax highlighting
* File dependency handling for exercises
* Argument and global variable handlers.
* PHP function reference
* Custom themes
* Code inspection tools (eg Kint, Krumo etc)
