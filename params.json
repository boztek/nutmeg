{"name":"Nutmeg","tagline":"Makes learning PHP palatable.","body":"# nutmeg\r\n\r\nNutmeg is a learning tool for PHP educators (and students). It provides a\r\nminimal wrapper around students PHP exercises in a way which handles mistakes\r\ngracefully, helps students and teachers understand their code, and takes care of\r\nbasic things which students shouldn't have to write in a PHP class, like table\r\nstyles.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Prepare a set of PHP exercises for Students to try out\r\n* Web front-end for listing exercises\r\n* Side-by-side comparison of students code and output, in the browser\r\n* PHP syntax highlighting\r\n* Graceful error handling for student's code\r\n* Reskin with CSS (currently limited)\r\n* GPL v2 licenced\r\n\r\n## Nutmeg for educators\r\n\r\nNutmeg helps you help student to learn PHP, by providing a way to serve up PHP\r\nexercises in a relatively straightforward way.\r\n\r\n### Getting set up\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n* [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)\r\n\r\n1. Download or checkout the latest version of Nutmeg.\r\n2. Run `composer install` to get the dependencies and autoloaders built.\r\n3. Visit `/exercises` to customise the exercises available to your students.\r\n  * The list of exercises is stored in `/exercises/config.yaml`\r\n  * Each exercise is a simple PHP file.\r\n\r\n## Nutmeg for students\r\n\r\nIf you don't already know PHP, Nutmeg is not currently ready for you to start\r\nusing it without the supervision of a tutor.\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\nNutmeg is in early Alpha. Its basic code loading and viewing features are complete,\r\nbut are not extensively tested.\r\n\r\nSome of the features we have in mind:\r\n\r\n* Load sample code into exercise view\r\n* Better syntax highlighting\r\n* File dependency handling for exercises\r\n* Argument and global variable handlers.\r\n* PHP function reference\r\n* Custom themes\r\n* Code inspection tools (eg Kint, Krumo etc)\r\n\r\n## Who made this?\r\n\r\nNutmeg is written and maintained by Chris Skene.
